Check all 4 Project Repos for all optional components! 

The Project uses in this model 4 Physical Buttons, but it can emulate much more Keys
while Long Press and hold the left front key + one of the 3 other switches, we have 3 more keys. 
Like the "Shift" Key on your keyboard does.
These keys can be stored in profiles and can be mapped to any keyboard or gamepad HID output.
This will give more controll over the game`s menu system, reset view in VR and other available features.
Plus we have 4 more Virtual Buttons in combination with the gyro sensor.
In long pressed mode (aka shift mode) we can take nudges or tilting the controller to simulate 4 more keys to trigger in game functions.


You can flash, config and debug the device with an usb cable and your browser. 
(Testet with Edge/Chrome. Check your browser for USB support enabled.)
